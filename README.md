## Sankofa: A Browser Extension by Vectara üöÄ
[Sankofa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankofa), which means ‚Äúto retrieve" in the [Twi language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twi_language) of [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana), 
is a browser extension created by Vectara. Its goal is to demonstrate the use of Vectara and its powerful semantic search and summarization capabilities.

When using Sankofa you can index web pages you visit (or instruct Sankofa to do so automatically). After pages are indexed
in a Vectara corpus, you can us Sankofa to find pages you've visited before, ask questions about the content of pages you had
visited or find pages similar to a page you are now visiting in your browser.
